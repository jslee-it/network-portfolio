# Network Engineering Portfolio

This repository contains a series of hands-on networking labs designed to demonstrate practical routing, switching, WAN deployment, and traffic control concepts using Cisco IOS in Packet Tracer.

The labs focus on structured design, dynamic routing implementation, access control enforcement, and validation using CLI-based troubleshooting.

## Completed Projects

### Segmented Enterprise LAN
- VLAN segmentation and 802.1Q trunking  
- Inter-VLAN routing (router-on-a-stick)  
- ACL-controlled inter-VLAN access  
- Layer 2/Layer 3 validation and troubleshooting  

### Static to OSPF WAN Migration
- Multi-router WAN topology  
- Static routing baseline and migration to OSPF  
- Neighbor adjacency verification  
- Route propagation validation  

### Asymmetric WAN Policy Enforcement (EIGRP + ACL)
- Multi-hop EIGRP deployment  
- Serial WAN configuration with DCE clocking  
- Extended ACL implementation for asymmetric traffic control  
- EIGRP metric manipulation and validation

### Scalable Network Expansion and Policy Enforcement (ROAS + EIGRP + ACL)
- HQ migration to Router-on-a-Stick for segmented VLAN architecture
- Branch Growth LAN deployment with verified EIGRP convergence
- Dedicated server VLAN implementation (10.10.40.0/24)
- Extended ACL design, sequencing correction, and policy validation

## In Progress

Additional labs expanding on WAN design, routing control, and infrastructure services (DHCP/DNS integration) are currently in development.
